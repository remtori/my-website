I just bought a new keyboard for around 120$ (2,650,000Ä‘). My first impression is... not really good, i used to the standard full size layout so the compact layout in this keyboard is really putting me off.

The typing experiment is okay at best, the keycap feel good to touch (i dont know how long will that keep up?). Damn, writing without a spell/grammar checker is hard, just do its already my future self.

Before this i use a keyboard cherry mx brown switch, which most people dislike. I affair to say this but, maybe... just maybe... i prefer the brown switch :3 

Lets just get used to this first~
